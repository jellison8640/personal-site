title: R Work Samples
---

This page contains the links to show some of the different work I've done with R. 
I've presented a handful of different workshops to the "Working Group" within the Graduate Student Organization (GSO) for my departmentâ€” NMUS FWCE, which can be found below. 
Additionally, I have the code from a final project I did for a course in which I analyzed spatial point-patterns in R. 


Sample work is presented from newest to oldest:
- Nest Survival Models with JAGS/jagsUI (hopefully coming soon!)
- [Data Vis in R with ggplot2](https://jellison8640.github.io/site/rdatavis.html)
