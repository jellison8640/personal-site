# Who am I?
<img align="right" width="480" height="640" src="https://github.com/jellison8640/site/blob/master/IMG_5479.HEIC">
My name is Jordan and I earned a BA from Colorado College in 2019. Though my undergraduate thesis fit the theme of predation ecology [The Rodent Eats the Raptor](https://digitalccbeta.coloradocollege.edu/pid/coccc:31273 "My Thesis!"), I am most interested in working with birds in the areas of spatial ecology.

## Why make this page?

Thus far, all my coding has been what I've been able to figure out analyzing various datasets in R. I've decided that maybe it's time to start sharing some of the code that I've been working on. 

### Potential Topics THUS far

1. lidar build dem/dtm/chm
2. thesis? code/graphs?
3. links to **estero la cruz guilds**
4. biodiversity at estero la cruz
5. ????
