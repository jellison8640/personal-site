title: Welcome

I am a recent graduate passionate about avian conservation and ecology. I have experience working with small owls, diurnal raptors and songbirds. Since early 2020, I have been working a waterbird conservation internship in Bah√≠a de Kino, Sonora, Mexico. I have experience working with GIS and performing a variety of statistical analyses. I intend to apply to graduate school in the near future and hope to complete a project that combine my two primary interests- ornithology and spatial ecology.
