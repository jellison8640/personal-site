I am a recent graduate passionate about avian conservation and ecology. I have experience working with small owls, diurnal raptors, songbirds and waterbirds. I most recenetly worked a waterbird conservation internship in Bah√≠a de Kino, Sonora, Mexico for the first half of 2020. I have experience working with GIS and performing a variety of statistical analyses. I intend to apply to graduate school in the near future and hope to complete a project that combined my two primary interests- ornithology and spatial ecology.
