I am a recent graduate passionate about avian conservation and ecology. I have experience working with small owls, diurnal raptors, songbirds and waterbirds. I most recenetly worked a waterbird conservation internship in Bah√≠a de Kino, Sonora, Mexico for the first half of 2020. I have experience working with GIS and performing a variety of statistical analyses. I'm currently searching for a graduate school opportunity to begin in 2021 and hope to complete a project in which I can further develop my quantitaive skills as an ornithologist and ecologist.
