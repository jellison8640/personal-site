I am a recent graduate passionate about avian conservation and ecology. I the first half of 2020 in Bah√≠a de Kino, Sonora, Mexico working a waterbird conservation internship, but have also previously worked with small owls, diurnal raptors and songbirds. I have experience performing a variety of statistical analyses as well as extensively experience working with GIS. I look forward to entering a master's program at NMSU in January 2021.
