I am a second-year MS student in Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Ecology at New Mexico State University. I am studying the nest distribution patterns and effects of landscape on Burrowing Owl nest survival and productivity.

I have previously worked with small owls, diurnal raptors, waterbirds and songbirds. I also have experience performing a variety of statistical analyses on various longitudinal data sets, as well as extensive experience working with GIS.
